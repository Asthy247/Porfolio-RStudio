Project: Iris Dataset Cleaning and Visualization


**Repository for Data Cleaning Iris Dataset:**
This repository also contains R code for cleaning and visualizing the Iris dataset, a classic dataset used in machine learning. 
The code performs tasks such as handling missing values, converting data types, and removing outliers.

**Requirements:**

RStudio
tidyverse package
Usage:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the R Markdown file iris_cleaning.Rmd in RStudio.
Knit the document to generate an HTML or PDF output.
Code Structure:
The Data CLeaning Iris Dataset.Rmd file includes the following sections:

**Data Loading: Loads the Iris dataset.**
Data Exploration: Provides basic information about the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, converts data types, and removes outliers.
Data Visualization: Creates a histogram of sepal length.
Results
The cleaned dataset is saved as cleaned_iris. The histogram shows the distribution of sepal lengths after outlier removal.
