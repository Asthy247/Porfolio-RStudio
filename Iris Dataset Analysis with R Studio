Project Overview
This repository contains code and analysis related to the Iris dataset, a classic dataset used for introductory data analysis, hypotheis testing, and correlation. 
The goal of this project is to explore the Iris dataset, visualize its characteristics, and conduct hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between features and species.

Data Exploration
Dataset: The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers from three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.   

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Histograms to visualize the distribution of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Scatter plots to examine relationships between features.
Box plots to compare the distributions of petal length and petal width across species.

Code:
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Load the Iris dataset
data(iris)

# Histogram of sepal length
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Length Distribution")

# Scatter plot of sepal length vs. sepal width by species
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width   
 by Species")
 

# Box plot of petal length by species
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Petal Length by Species")

              Hypothesis Testing and Correlation Analysis
Hypothesis Testing: Conduct an ANOVA test to determine if there are significant differences in sepal length among the species.
Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlation coefficients between sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# ANOVA test
model <- aov(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
summary(model)

# Correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(iris[, 1:4])
print(correlation_matrix)

Results
ANOVA: The ANOVA test shows that there are significant differences in sepal length among the three species (p-value < 2e-16).

Correlation: The correlation matrix reveals strong positive correlations between sepal length and petal length, as well as between sepal width and petal width. There are negative correlations between sepal length and sepal width, and between petal length and petal width.


Conclusions
Based on the analysis, we can conclude that sepal length is a significant factor in distinguishing the iris species. Additionally, the strong correlations between sepal length and petal length, as well as between sepal width and petal width, suggest that these features are interrelated.
